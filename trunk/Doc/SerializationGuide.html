          <p>The Json.NET serializer can serialize a wide variety of .NET objects. This guide 
              looks at how it works at a high level and in more detail.</p>
        <h3>Summary</h3>
        <p>At a high level, the Json.NET serializer will convert primitive .NET values into 
            primitive JSON values, .NET arrays and collections to JSON arrays and everything 
            else to JSON objects.</p>
        <p>Json.NET will throw an error if it encounters incorrect JSON when deserializing a 
            value. For example if the serializer encounters a JSON property with an array of 
            values and the type of matching .NET property is not a collection then an error 
            will be thrown, and vice-versa. </p>

        <h3>Breakdown of Type Serialization</h3>
        <h4><strong>Objects</strong></h4>
        <p>.NET types that don’t fall into any other category listed below (i.e. aren’t 
            lists, dictionaries, dynamic, implement ISerializable, etc) are serialized as 
            JSON objects.</p>
        <p>By default types are serialized in opt-out mode. What that means is all public 
            fields and properties with getters are automatically serialized to JSON and 
            members that shouldn’t be serialized are opted-out using the 
            JsonIgnoreAttribute. To serialize private members the JsonPropertyAttribute can 
            be placed on private fields and properties or the DefaultMembersSearchFlags can 
            be changed on DefaultContractResolver to change how members are serialized on 
            all types.</p>
        <p>Types can also be serialized using opt-in mode. Only fields that have a 
            JsonPropertyAttribute or DataMemberAttribute on them will be serialized. Opt-in 
            mode for an object is specified using the JsonObjectAttribute on the class. </p>
        <h4><strong>IEnumerable, Lists and Arrays</strong></h4>
        <p>.NET lists (types that inherit from IEnumerable) and .NET arrays are converted to 
            JSON arrays. Because JSON arrays only support a range of values and not 
            properties, any additional properties and fields declared on .NET collections 
            are not serialized. In situations where a JSON array is not wanted the 
            JsonObjectAttribute can be placed on a .NET type that implements IEnumerable to 
            force the type to be serialized as a JSON object instead.</p>
        <p>Note that if TypeNameHandling or PreserveReferencesHandling has been enabled for 
            JSON arrays on the serializer then JSON arrays are wrapped it a containing 
            object. The object will have the type name/reference properties and a $values 
            property which will have the collection data.</p>
        <p>When deserializing if a member is typed as the interface IList<T> then it will be 
            deserialized as a List<T>.</p>

            <a href="SerializingCollections.html">Serializing Collections </a></p>
        <h4><strong>Dictionarys and Hashtables</strong></h4>
        <p>.NET dictionaries (types that inherit from IDictionary) are converted to JSON 
            objects. Note that only the dictionary name/values will be written to the JSON 
            object when serializing and properties on the JSON object will be added to the 
            dictionary’s name/values when deserializing. Additional members on the .NET 
            dictionary are ignored during serialization.</p>
        <p>When deserializing if a member is typed as the interface IDictionary<TKey, Value> 
            then it will be deserialized as a Dictionary<TKey, TValue>.</p>
        <p>Read more about serializing collections here:
            <a href="SerializingCollections.html">Serializing Collections</a></p>
        <h4><strong>Untyped Objects</strong></h4>
        <p>.NET properties on a class that don’t specify a type (i.e. they are just object) 
            are serialized as usual. When untyped properties are deserialized the serializer 
            has no way to know what type to create (unless type name handling is enabled and 
            the JSON contains the type names).</p>
        <p>For these untyped properties the Json.NET serializer will read the JSON into LINQ 
            to JSON objects and set them to the property. </p>
        <h4><strong>Dynamic</strong></h4>
        <p>.NET dynamic objects (introduced in .NET 4) are serialized as JSON objects. A 
            property is written for every member name returned by 
            IDynamicMetaObjectProvider.GetDynamicMemberNames.</p>
        <p>When deserializing the serializer first attempts to set JSON property values on a 
            normal .NET member with the matching name. If no .NET member is found with the 
            property name then the serializer will call SetMember on the dynamic object.</p>
        <p>Because a dynamic property on a class doesn’t specify a type, Json.NET has no way 
            to know what type to create for it when deserializing (unless type name handling 
            is enabled and the JSON contains the type name). LINQ to JSON objects will be 
            created for the JSON. </p>
        <h4><strong>ISerializable</strong></h4>
        <p>Types that implement ISerializable are serialized as JSON objects. When 
            serializing only the values returned from ISerializable.GetObjectData are used; 
            members on the type are ignored. When deserializing the constructor with a 
            SerializationInfo and StreamingContext is called, passing the JSON object’s 
            values.</p>
        <p>In situations where this behaviour is not wanted the JsonObjectAttribute can be 
            placed on a .NET type that implements ISerializable to force it to be serialized 
            as a normal JSON object. </p>
        <h4><strong>LINQ to JSON</strong></h4>
        <p>LINQ to JSON types (e.g. JObject, JArray) are automatically serialized and 
            deserialized to their equivalent JSON when encountered by the Json.NET 
            serializer. </p>
        <h4><strong>JsonConverter</strong></h4>
        <p>Serialization of values that are convertible by a JsonConverter (i.e. CanConvert 
            returns true for its type) is completely overridden by the JsonConverter. The 
            test to see whether a value can be converted by a JsonSerializer takes 
            precedence over all other tests.</p>
        <p>JsonConverters can be defined and specified in a number of places: in an 
            attribute on a member, in an attribute on a class and added to the 
            JsonSerializer’s converters collection. The priority of which JsonConverter is 
            used is the JsonConverter defined by attribute on a member then the 
            JsonConverter defined by an attribute on a class and finally any converters 
            passed to the JsonSerializer.</p>
